# NeRF

> My implementation of NeRF (Neural Radiance Fields) in PyTorch.

This repository contains my implementation of the NeRF (Neural Radiance Fields) model in PyTorch. The code is based on the original paper by Mildenhall et al. (2020) and the official implementation by Ben Mildenhall. The code is written in a modular way, making it easy to experiment with different architectures and hyperparameters.

## Features

- **`simple_nerf.ipynb`**: A simple implementation of NeRF in PyTorch and IPython notebook format.
- **`tiny_nerf_data.npz`**: A small dataset for experiment evaluation.
  - Original dataset URL: http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~viscomp/projects/LF/papers/ECCV20/nerf/tiny_nerf_data.npz
